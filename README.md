# CS-255-Business-Requirements-Document-and-System-Design-Document
This project was for the client DriverPass. DriverPass is a burgeoning driver's training company that aims to help fewer people pass the DMV's written and road test. They intend to do this by providing private driving lessons, online driving tutorials, and practice written tests. This project focused on taking what they requested in our initial meeting and turning it into various software design documents. They were requesting a website that users could log into, select a learning package, view online content, take practice tests, and schedule driving lessons.
